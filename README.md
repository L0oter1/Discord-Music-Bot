This is just a fun project I made. This bot sucks and doesn't work anymore because yt-dl stopped working but it was very fun to make and I enjoyed every process of learning new code and logic.

This project taught me the use of APIs and reading API libraries. 

It also taught me about async functions in python and their importance. 

This was definitely fun learning some python. The best part was when this worked, I was so happy I was talking about it to all my friends.
